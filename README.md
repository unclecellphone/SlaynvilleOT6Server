# Uncle cellphone's Downgrade 6.X

#### This code is based on Nekiro's Downgrade 7.X
#### Downgraded from 7.72 Nekiro to 6.6 by Unclecellphone

# Hardcore Tibia 6.X Gameplay Server

#### This code will run a tibia OT gameplay server **[(our corresponding client found here)](https://github.com/unclecellphone/SlaynvilleOT6Client)**
#### This code should compile and run on Windows and Ubuntu.  
#### You'll likely have to fight VSPKG to get it to compile on Windows,
#### but **[the generic OT installation here](https://docs.otland.net/ots-guide/running-your-first-linux-web-and-otserver)** 
#### should work for you, in general, on Ubuntu.  

# What the heck is Slaynville?

## Bugs

If you find any bug and believe it should be fixed, submit an issue in issues section, just please follow the issue template.

## Notes

The key.pem and RSA keys of this have been changed from Slaynville's implementation of this codebase - so you will not be able to connect to an instance of this server via the Publicly available slaynville client, nor will you be able to use **[the client codebase](https://github.com/unclecellphone/SlaynvilleOT6Client)** to recompile, change, and connect to slaynville servers either.  This is for educational purposes only.
